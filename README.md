SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
A SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is an automation control system that is used in industries such as energy, oil and gas, water, power, and many more.
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is a type of industrial control system used to monitor and control industrial and infrastructure processes, as well as critical machinery. 
The system has a centralized system that monitors and controls entire sites, ranging from an industrial plant to a complex of plants across the country.
A SCADA system works by operating with signals that communicate via channels to provide the user with remote controls of any equipment in a given system. 
It also implements a distributed database, or tag database, that contains tags or points throughout the plant. 
These points represent a single input or output value that is monitored or controlled by the SCADA system in the centralized control room. 
The points are stored in the distributed database as value-timestamp pairs. It's very common to set up the SCADA systems to also acquire metadata, such as programmable logic controller (PLC) register paths and alarm statistics.
While these systems simplify a given infrastructure, their components are quite complex. 
There are five essential composing parts of a SCADA system:
•	Human Machine Interface (HMI)
•	supervisory system
•	Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)
•	Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
•	communication infrastructures
 
The HMI processes data from each tag and sends it to a human operator, where he or she then can monitor or control the system. 
The supervisory system gathers the data sent from each tag and sends commands or operations to the process. 
The RTUs connect sensors and convert their signals to digital data and send it to the supervisory system, where it can be stored in a distributed database. 
PLCs are used as field devices because they are much more versatile and economical than process-specific RTUs. Finally, the communication infrastructure delivers connectivity to the supervisory system and then to the RTUs and PLCs for the user to command. 
The communication infrastructure is necessary to relay data from remote RTU/PLCs, which run along electric grids, water supplies, and pipelines. 
Communication is the absolute most essential link for a SCADA system to operate properly; however, how well the system manages communication from HMI to RTUs and PLCs fundamentally determines how successful a SCADA system can be. 
Below is a figure of what a basic SCADA system might look like for a given infrastructure.
